# Conclusion

For the implementation of the 6-class image classifier, an emphasis was put on finding a  method that combined feature extraction and classification algorithm to give highest accuracy. Of the methods that were implemented, the DenseNet + Multilayer Perceptron algorithm gave the best results (Validation accuracy = 92.57% and Evaluation accuracy = 84.363%).
